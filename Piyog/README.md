## 🤖 The "Virtual HQ" (Multi-Agent Architecture)

Piyog operates using a decentralized workforce of specialized AI agents. These "virtual employees" collaborate to handle the complexities of scaling a fitness startup in the Indian market.

### The Specialized Workforce

| --- | --- | --- |
| **⚖️ The Registrar** | Government & Compliance | Managing GST, MSME registration, and Indian regulatory filings. |
| **📈 The Strategist** | Marketing & Growth | Brand positioning, customer acquisition, and social media automation. |

### The Orchestrator (The Manager Agent)

To ensure synergy, the system is governed by a **Manager/Orchestrator Agent**. This agent acts as the "CEO’s Right Hand" by:

* **Daily Synchronization:** Conducting automated stand-ups with all agents to track progress.
* **Dependency Mapping:** Ensuring the *Engineer* has the specs from the *Textile Agent* before manufacturing begins.
* **Executive Reporting:** Providing the human founders with consolidated daily and weekly progress reports.
* **Alignment:** Ensuring every agent’s output directly contributes to the quarterly business goals.
